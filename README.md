This is the project template.

To use this, ask Etienne or someone with google code administrative rights to
create a new repository for your project, and choose to clone the template
repository.

You can then check out a copy of that new repository, and edit the .hg/hgrc
file to add your googlecode password into the default path, like below:

[paths]
default = https://email%40address:password@code.google.com/p/sunswift.project-name/

By cloning the template repository, you will also get a copy of scandal and
libaltium. These files ARE NOT in your repository. They are in their own
repositories. However, if you make changes to libaltium or scandal, you can commit
the changes in those repositories for others to make use of.
